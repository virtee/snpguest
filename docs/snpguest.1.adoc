NAME
----
snpguest - Command line tool for managing the AMD SEV-SNP Guest environment.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*snpguest* [GLOBAL_OPTIONS] [COMMAND] [COMMAND_ARGS] [SUBCOMMAND] [SUBCOMMAND_ARGS]
*snpguest* [_-h, --help_]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
snpguest is a CLI utility for navigating and interacting with the AMD SEV-SNP
guest firmware device of a guest system.


GLOBAL OPTIONS
--------------
*-q, --quiet*:: Don't print any output to the console.


COMMANDS
--------
*snpguest report*::
    usage: snpguest report $ATT_REPORT_PATH $REQUEST_FILE [-v, --vmpl] $VMPL [-r, --random] [-p, --platform]
    
    Requests an attestation report from the host and writes it in a file with the provided request data and vmpl. 
    Will write the contents of the attestation report in binary format into the specified report path.
    A path for the attestation report must be provided.
    User can pass 64 bytes of data in any file format into $REQUEST_FILE in order to use that data to request the attestation report.
    The user can use the --random flag to generate and use random data for request data.
    For Microsoft Hyper-V guests, a user can use the --platform flag to use the request data that was pre-generated
    from the platform. Currently, for Hyper-V guests, --platform is required, as there is no ability to write
    request data for the attestation report.
    If the user uses the --random flag, then the data will be written into the file they provided in $REQUEST_FILE.
    VMPL is an optional parameter and it defaults to 1.
    
    options:
    -h, --help  show a help message.
    -p, --platform Use platform generated 64 bytes of data to pass for the report request (Only available for Hyper-V).
    -r, --random  Generate 64 random bytes of data to pass for the report request (Not available for Hyper-V).
    -v, --vmpl Specify a different vmpl level for the attestation report (defaults to 1).

*snpguest certificates*::
    usage: snpguest certificates $ENCODING $CERTS_DIR
    
    Requests the certificate chain (ASK, ARK & VCEK) from host memory (requests extended-config).
    The user needs to specify the certificate encoding they would like store the certs in [PEM | DER].
    Currently only PEM and DER encondings are supported.
    All of the certs will be in the same encoding.
    The user also needs to provide the path to the directory where the certs will be stored.
    If the certificate already exists in the provided directory, it will be overwritten.
    The attestation report will be ingored for this request, to request and store an attestation report use the "report" command.
    
    options:
    -h, --help  show a help message

*snpguest fetch ca*::
    usage: snpguest fetch ca $ENCODING $PROCESSOR_MODEL $CERTS_DIR

    Requests the certificate authority chain (ARK & ASK) from the KDS.
    The user needs to specify the certificate encoding they would like store the certs in [PEM | DER].
    Currently only PEM and DER encondings are supported.
    Both of the certs will be in the same encoding.
    The user must specify their host processor model [Milan | Genoa].
    The user needs to provide the path to the directory where the certs will be stored.
    If the certificates already exist in the provided directory, they will be overwritten.

    options:
    -h, --help show a help message

*snpguest fetch vcek*::
    usage: snpguest fetch vcek $ENCODING $PROCESSOR_MODEL $CERTS_DIR $ATT_REPORT_PATH

    Requests the VCEK certificate from the KDS.
    The user needs to specify the certificate encoding they would like store the cert in [PEM | DER].
    Currently only PEM and DER encondings are supported.
    The user must specify their host processor model [Milan | Genoa].
    The user needs to provide the path to the directory where the VCEK will be stored.
    If the certificate already exists in the provided directory, it will be overwritten.
    The user also needs to provide the path to a stored attestation report that will be used to request the VCEK.

    options:
    -h, --help show a help message

*snpguest guest verify certs*::
    usage: snpguest verify certs $CERTS_DIR

    Verifies that the provided certificate chain has been properly signed by each certificate.
    The user needs to provide a directory were all 3 of the certificates are stored (ARK,ASK and VCEK).
    Error will be raised if any of the certificates fails verification.

    options:
    -h, --help show a help message

*snpguest verify attestation*::
    usage: snpguest verify attestation $CERTS_DIR $ATT_REPORT_PATH [-t, --tcb] [-s, --signature]

    Verifies the contents of the Attestation Report using the VCEK certificate.
    The user needs to provide the path to the directory containing the VCEK certificate.
    The user also needs to provide the path to a stored attestation report to be verified.
    Error will be raised if the attestation verification fails at any point.
    The user can use the [-t, --tcb] flag to only validate the tcb contents of the report.
    The user can use the [-s, --signature] flag to only validate the report signature.

    options:
    -h, --help show a help message
    -t, --tcb verify the tcb section of the report only
    -s, --signature verify the signature of the report only

*snpguest key*::
    usage: snpguest key $KEY_PATH $ROOT_KEY_SELECT [-g, --guest_field_select] [-s, --guest_svn] [-t, --tcb_version] [-v, --vmpl]
    
    Creates the derived key based on input parameters and stores it.
    $KEY_PATH is the path to store the derived key.
    $ROOT_KEY_SELECT is the root key from which to derive the key. Input either "vcek" or "vmrk".
    The --guest_field_select option specifies which Guest Field Select bits to enable. It is a 6 digit binary string. For each bit, 0 denotes off and 1 denotes on.
    The least significant (rightmost) bit is Guest Policy followed by Image ID, Family ID, Measurement, SVN, TCB Version which is the most significant (leftmost) bit. 
     example: snpguest key $KEY_PATH $ROOT_KEY_SELECT --guest_field_select 100001 (Denotes Guest Policy:On, Image ID:Off, Family ID:Off, Measurement:Off, SVN:Off, TCB Version:On)
    The --guest_svn specifies the guest SVN to mix into the key. Must not exceed the guest SVN provided at launch in the ID block.
    The --tcb_version specified the TCB version to mix into the derived key. Must not exceed CommittedTcb.

    -t, --tcb_version               Specify the TCB version to mix into the derived key. 
    -v, --vmpl                      Specify VMPL level the Guest is running on. Defaults to 1.

*snpguest generate measurement*::
    usage: snpguest generate measurement [-v, --vcpus] [--vcpu-type] [--vcpu-sig] [--vcpu-family] [--vcpu-model] [--vcpu-stepping] [-t, --vmm-type] [-o ,--ovmf] [-k, --kernel]
            [-i, --initrd] [-a, --append] [-g, --guest-features] [--ovmf-hash] [-f, --output-format] [-m, --measurement-file]
    
    Calculates a secure guest expected launch digest measurement.
    Every parameter passed in is used to calculate this measurement, but the user does not need to provide every parameter.
    The only mandatory parameters are the [-o, --ovmf] parameter which is a path to the ovmf file used to launch the secure guest, and provide the guest vcpu type.
    There are 3 ways to provide the vcpu type, and the 3 of them are mutually exclusive (will get an error if the user tries to use more than one method):
        - [--vcpu-type] A string with the vcpu-type used to launch the secure guest
        - [--vcpu-sig] The signature of the vcpu-type used to launch the secure guest
        - [--vcpu-family] [--vcpu-model] [--vcpu-stepping] The family, model and stepping of the vcpu used to launch the secure guest.
            Family, model and stepping have to be used together, if they're not all provided together an error will be raised.
    If the user provides the [-k, --kernel] parameter to calculate the measurement, they also need to provide [-i, --initrd] and [-a, --append].
    There were kernel features added that affect the result of the measurement if those are enabled. With the [-g, --guest-features] parameter the user can provide which of this features are enabled in their kernel.
    The [-g, --guest-features] can be a hex or decimal number that cover the features enabled. 
    For information on the guest-features bitfield checkout: https://github.com/virtee/sev/blob/a3c91d7b6e742c1b5685a7e0c1e5464819527b06/src/measurement/vmsa.rs#L139
    A user can use a pre-calculated ovmf-hash using [--ovmf-hash], but the ovmf file still has to be provided.
    The calculated measurement will be printed in the console, if the user wishes to store the measurement value they can provide a file path with [-m, --measurement-file] and the measurement will get written there.
    If the [--quiet] flag is used, nothing will be printed out.
