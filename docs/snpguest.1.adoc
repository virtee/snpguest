SYNOPSIS
--------
*snpguest* [GLOBAL_OPTIONS] [_COMMAND_] [_COMMAND_ARGS_] +
*snpguest* [_-h, --help_] +


DESCRIPTION
-----------
snpguest is a CLI utility for navigating and interacting with the AMD SEV-SNP
guest firmware device of a host system.


GLOBAL OPTIONS
--------------
*-q, --quiet*:: Don't print any output to the console.


COMMANDS
--------
*snpguest request report*::
    usage: snpguest request report --extended --random [-m, --message_version] $MESSAGE_VERSION [-v, --vmpl] $VMPL --request $REQUEST_FILE [-a, --att-report] $ATTESTATION_REPORT_PATH --ark $ARK_PATH --ask $ASK_PATH --vcek $vcek_path
    
    Requests an attestation report from the host. Will write the contents of the attestation report in binary format into the specified report path.
    If no path is provided for the attestation report, the path will default to current directory ("./attestation_report.bin").
    User can pass 64 bytes of data in any file format into request_file in order to use that data to request the attestation report.
    The user can use the --random flag to generate a request-file with random data. If the user provides a request-file path and uses the --random flag, the data will be written into the provided file.
    If the user uses the --random flag, but does not provide a request-file path, then the data will be written into the default file in current directory ("./random-request-file.txt").
    Message-version and VMPL are both optional paramaters, they will default to 1.
    If the --extended flag is raised, then an extended report be requested.
    The certificates will be cycled through and placed into their specified paths.
    If no cert path is provided, it will default to "./certs/" directory, if the directory is missing it will be created.
    The certs will be stored in the same format as they were loaded (".pem" or ".der")

    options:
    -h, --help  show a help message
    -e, --extended  request an extended report
    -r, --random  generate 64 random bytes of data to pass for the report request

*snpguest request certificate-chain*::
    usage: snpguest request certificate-chain [-p,--processor] $PROCESSOR_TYPE --ark $ARK_PATH  --ask $ASK_PATH

    Requests the CA certificate chain from the KDS by creating the URL.
    The user mustspecify their host processor type using the --processor flag.
    The certificates (ARK and ARK) will be written into the provided directory.
    Cert paths default to "./certs" directory, if directory is missing it will be created, and both certificates will be written in .pem formats.

    options:
    -h, --help show a help message

*snpguest request vcek*::
    usage: snpguest request vcek [-p, --processor] $PROCESSOR_TYPE --vcek $VCEK_PATH  [-a,--attestation-report] $ATTESTATION_REPORT_PATH

    Requests the vcek certificate from the KDS.
    The user must specify their host processor type using the processor flag.
    The user needs to provide a path to an attestation report in order to request the vcek.
    If no path is provided for attestation report, the program will look for an attestation report in the local directory by default ("./attestation_report.bin").
    If no attestation report was found in either the default path or the path provided by the user, then the program will give the user the option to request an attestation report.
    The attestation report will have default values (vmpl=1, message_version=1) and a randomly generated request data for the report.
    The random data will be written to the local directory. ("./random-request-file.txt")
    The certificate will be written into the provided directory.
    Cert path defaults to "./certs" directory, if directory is missing it will be created, and the vcek will be written in .der format.

    options:
    -h, --help show a help message

*snpguest guest verify-root-of-trust*::
    usage: snpguest verify-root-of-trust --ark_path $ARK_PATH --ask_path $ASK_PATH --vcek_path $vcek_path

    Verifies that the provided certificate chain has been properly signed by each certificate.
    The user needs to provide a path to each of the certificates that need to be verified.
    If no path is provided for the certificates, the program will look for them in the local cert directory ("./certs/")
    Error will be raised if any of the certificates fails verification.

    options:
    -h, --help show a help message

*snpguest guest verify-tcb*::
    usage: snpguest verify-tcb --vcek_path $vcek_path --att_report_path $ATTESTATION_REPORT_PATH

    Verifies the trusted compute base using the provided attestation report and VCEK certificate
    The user needs to provide a path to the attestation report and to the VCEK certificate.
    If no path is provided for the attestation report, the program will look for it in the local directory ("./attestation_report.bin").
    If no path is provided for the certificate, the program will look for it in the local cert directory ("./certs/").
    Error will be raised if there is any mismatch between the report TCB and the VCEK TCB contents.

    options:
    -h, --help show a help message

*snpguest guest verify-attestation-signature*::
    usage: snpguest verify-attestation-signature --vcek_path $vcek_path --att_report_path $ATTESTATION_REPORT_PATH

    Verifies that the provided attestation report was actually signed by the VCEK.
    The user needs to provide a path to the attestation report and to the VCEK certificate.
    If no path is provided for the attestation report, the program will look for it in the local directory ("./attestation_report.bin").

*snpguest guest display-attestation*::
    usage: snpguest display-attestation --att_report_path $ATTESTATION_REPORT_PATH

    Prints attestation report into terminal.
    The user needs to provide a path to the attestation report they would like to display.
