NAME
----
snpguest - Command line tool for managing the AMD SEV-SNP Guest environment.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*snpguest* [GLOBAL_OPTIONS] [COMMAND] [COMMAND_ARGS] [SUBCOMMAND] [SUBCOMMAND_ARGS]
*snpguest* [_-h, --help_]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
snpguest is a CLI utility for navigating and interacting with the AMD SEV-SNP
guest firmware device of a guest system.


GLOBAL OPTIONS
--------------
*-q, --quiet*:: Don't print any output to the console.


COMMANDS
--------
*snpguest report*::
    usage: snpguest report $ATT_REPORT_PATH $REQUEST_FILE [-v, --vmpl] $VMPL [-r, --random] [-p, --platform]
    
    Requests an attestation report from the host and writes it in a file with the provided request data and vmpl. 
    Will write the contents of the attestation report in binary format into the specified report path.
    A path for the attestation report must be provided.
    User can pass 64 bytes of data in any file format into $REQUEST_FILE in order to use that data to request the attestation report.
    The user can use the --random flag to generate and use random data for request data.
    For Microsoft Hyper-V guests, a user can use the --platform flag to use the request data that was pre-generated
    from the platform. Currently, for Hyper-V guests, --platform is required, as there is no ability to write
    request data for the attestation report.
    If the user uses the --random flag, then the data will be written into the file they provided in $REQUEST_FILE.
    VMPL is an optional parameter and it defaults to 1.
    
    options:
    -h, --help  show a help message
    -r, --random  Generate 64 random bytes of data to pass for the report request
    -v, --vmpl Specify a different vmpl level for the attestation report (defaults to 1)

*snpguest certificates*::
    usage: snpguest certificates $ENCODING $CERTS_DIR
    
    Requests the certificate chain (ASK, ARK & VCEK) from host memory (requests extended-config).
    The user needs to specify the certificate encoding they would like store the certs in [PEM | DER].
    Currently only PEM and DER encondings are supported.
    All of the certs will be in the same encoding.
    The user also needs to provide the path to the directory where the certs will be stored.
    If the certificate already exists in the provided directory, it will be overwritten.

    options:
    -h, --help  show a help message

*snpguest fetch ca*::
    usage: snpguest fetch ca $ENCODING $PROCESSOR_MODEL $CERTS_DIR

    Requests the certificate authority chain (ARK & ASK) from the KDS.
    The user needs to specify the certificate encoding they would like store the certs in [PEM | DER].
    Currently only PEM and DER encondings are supported.
    Both of the certs will be in the same encoding.
    The user must specify their host processor model [Milan | Genoa].
